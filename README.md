# Carrier Vanity Name

Carrier Vanity Name is a very simple app to change the carrier names on unrooted Android devices.

The changed names will persist through reboots. To revert them back, click the reset button in the app.

The app can also override the ISO country code of your SIM card. This can be useful to spoof your location to some region-locked apps like the Pixel Thermometer.

The app uses [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) to achieve this using carrier config overrides. This method was inspired by Kyujin Cho's [pixel-volte-patch](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch), which uses the same method to enable VoLTE on some Google Pixel and LG devices.

## üîß Enhancements in This Fork
This fork introduces several improvements:

- ‚úÖ **Support for VoWiFi Carrier Label Override**  
  Overrides `sem_vowifi_opname_string` in addition to `KEY_CARRIER_NAME_STRING`, allowing you to change the carrier label that appears during WiFi calling.

- üì± **Tasker Integration**  
  You can trigger carrier name changes via Tasker by sending a broadcast intent with Shizuku permission. Requires the [IntentTask plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.balda.intenttask) to support multiple extras.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **ADB-Friendly**  
  You can also change the carrier name using ADB shell commands.
